# Html Code Refactoring Project


## Why?
Given starter code of an html page I wanted to learn how to restructure and modify the code in order to better meet HTML5 structure and accessibility standards. 
I built this project in order to get a better understanding of HTML code as well as an understanding of CSS styling and modyfing existing html code. 
## What I learned
While working on this project I learned how to match classes within the HTML file to its counterpart in the CSS file. As well as read and comment code blocks to give a better understanding to the reader of the code. I also fixed minor bugs on the html such as a navigation link not properly jumping to the content on the webpage. As seen below
## Code Snippet
```html
<section id="search-engine-optimization" class="search-engine-optimization">
```
I also learned how to change image resources and add alt descriptions to images as shown below.

## Code Snippet
```html
<img src="./assets/images/search-engine-optimization.jpg" alt="table filled with study tools" class="float-left" />
<img src="./assets/images/online-reputation-management.jpg" alt="laptop ontop of a table" class="float-right" />
<img src="./assets/images/social-media-marketing.jpg" alt= "people collaborating around a desk"class="float-left" />
```
